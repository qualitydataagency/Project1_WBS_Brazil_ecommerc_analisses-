ECommerce Market Analisses of the Brasilian market Eniac - Magist

Client info:

Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. It was founded ten years ago in Spain and has since grown and expanded to other neighboring countries.
In addition to offering a wide catalog of products at competitive prices, Eniac provides friendly and professional tech support and consultation to its customers. The warmhearted spirit that thrives with direct contact with the customers is at the core of the company.
Since the company went public, investors have been pushing for Eniac to scale up the business and become a major e-commerce player globally. It goes without saying that it is an arduous challenge to do so while retaining the human side of the business, which is Eniac’s emblem.

Eniac’s scope (data from April 2017 to March 2018):

Revenue: €14 million
Average monthly revenue: €1.17 million
Average order price: €710
Average item price: €540

Background information:

Eniac is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market. Data shows that Brazil has an eCommerce revenue similar to that of Spain and Italy: an already huge market with an even bigger potential for growth. The problem for Eniac is the lack of knowledge of such a market. The company doesn’t have ties with local providers, package delivery services, or customer service agencies. Creating these ties and knowing the market would take a lot of time, while the board of directors has demanded the expansion to happen within the next year. Eniac’s catalogue is 100% tech products and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories.

Scope of work:

Explore  possibilities for Eniac expansion at the Brasilian market through Magist (Brazilian E-Commerce shop) and provide recomendations on expansion strategy possibilities.

Main concerns:

Eniac’s catalogue is 100% tech products and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories. 
It is not clear that Magist is a good partner for these high-end tech products.
Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. The delivery fees resulting from Magist’s deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? Are deliveries fast enough?

Other info:

Magist has allowed Eniac to access a snapshot of their database. The data might have the answer to these concerns.
The economic conditions of the deal are already being discussed. But not everyone in the company is happy moving on with this.
